FRT PROJECT
The README file provides an introduction to your yoga website 
and outlines its features. It includes instructions for getting 
started with the website locally and using its various components. 
Contributors are encouraged to improve the platform, and users can 
seek support if needed. The website offers yoga asanas, guided classes,
personalized accounts, a community forum, and a yoga blog.
It aims to inspire and support users on their yoga journey.
